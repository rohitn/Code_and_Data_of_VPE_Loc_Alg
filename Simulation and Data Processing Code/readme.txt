File "Simulation & Data Processing.nb" is a standard Mathematica notebook which can be openned and run only by Mathematica.
This notebook is created by Mathematica v11.3. For proper evaluation of all code inside, it is recommended to use at least Mathematica v11.0.
Figures are mostly drawn using open source packet "SciDraw" created by Mark A. Caprio. Detailed information and download of this packet can be found at https://scidraw.nd.edu/.

In the file, simulation of localization and shape formation are provided along with figures created by these code and used in the paper.
