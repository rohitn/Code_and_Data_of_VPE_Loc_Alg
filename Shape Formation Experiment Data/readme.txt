In our shape formation experiments, we directly shot photos of robots in each iterations (Though sometimes we will carelessly miss one or two frames...) and then use computer programs to do perspective transformation and extract actual position of robots.

All raw photos we captured are in the two sub-folders.

A "data.txt" file is presented in each folder, which stores the proceeded data in the form of {{iteration count,{position of robot 1, position of robot 2, ...}}, ...}
